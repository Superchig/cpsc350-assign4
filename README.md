## References
I used https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/abstract_class for information
on pure virtual base classes.

I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14965928/issue-with-inheritance-and-virtual-destructors-in-c
to learn that the base class destructor must be virtual but not pure virtual in
order to subclass it.
